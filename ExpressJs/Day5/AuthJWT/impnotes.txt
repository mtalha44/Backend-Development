user ko profile denay se pahley ye check karna hota ha 
key user ha kon . like ali wanna open his profile then
i will question who you are i ask some details like email , 
username and then i verify it in database if it available in 
system then i allow it to check its profile


if ali wants to see some products then i ask some details 
like product name , product price and then i verify it in 
database if it available in system then i allow it to check
 products .
if user wanna change product price then i ask some details 
and then check that is it authorized person means admin 
because some task only do by admin

if a request to server it will process and response and if 
i again send request then it again process means every time 
it need details like who you are?  
so that's why use cookies and sessions

if a send a request to server then it will process and ask 
details like who you are ?
and then server will generate a string it will store and 
send it back to the user browser . That will will help 
beacuse if i again send a request to server then server 
will process that string then beacuse of that server
recognze me and didn't ask any details about me . beacuse
now server know about you beacuse of that string 

we have to learn some different things 
like 
how to set cookies 
how to use bcrypt for password encryption and decryption
what is jwt and how to store data in jwt and how to
retrieve it back from jwt

if my paswword is talha@123 i can't save it like that beacuse it can be steal by hacker 
so it will change into 
talha@123 => wejlkwjcewrwklwekfwkfenwwkfn

so bcrypt hepls to convert password into taht string
